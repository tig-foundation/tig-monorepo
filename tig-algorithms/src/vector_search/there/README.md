# TIG Code Submission

## Submission Details

* **Challenge Name:** vector_search
* **Algorithm Name:** there
* **Copyright:** 2026 Rootz
* **Identity of Submitter:** Rootz
* **Identity of Creator of Algorithmic Method:** Rootz
* **Unique Algorithm Identifier (UAI):** null

## Additional Notes

GPU-accelerated exhaustive brute-force vector search achieving perfect quality (argmin ceiling) across all tracks.

Key improvements: Further optimised giving ~18% better runtime and 4x unroll on main loop

Requires 100b fuel for tracks 1-3, 200b fuel for tracks 4-5.
